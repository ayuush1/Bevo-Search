# Bevo-Search

**About The Projects**

This project is built using Python as a backend and Unity and C# as a frontend. Behind the gaming-styled animatated interface, where an animated Bevo is the guide, the desktop app uses InterSystem's Vector Search to optimize email search. It returns the results with the most relevance to the search queries outdoing the gmail search in long sentences.


**Pre requisites:**

Python should be installed

Relevant Python code must be ran in Iris-env 

Requires Google API Key to fetch email data

Require Windows Operating System

**Installation guide:**

The file is submitted as a raw file with hardcoded paths. The user should be update the paths based on their local path. This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
```
git clone 
```
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

Setup the Gmail API and download the credentials.json. Keep the credentials and the clone file in the same directory.

The csv and exe should be in the same directory. 


**Usage**

It optimizes the search for the emails by leveraging vector search, which highlights and focuses on the semantic relation between words, giving more relevant answer to longer phrases compared to Gmail's regular search bar.
